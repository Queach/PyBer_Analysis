# PyPlot Analysis

## Overview of Project
An analysis of "PyPlot" ride sharing data

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to use the data provided by PyPlot ride sharing company and provide generated graphs & business recommendations

## Analysis and Results
### Urban Cities
Urban cities have the largest total number of all statistics of the three city types, generating the most money overall and having the most drivers and riders 
but coming in last when it comes to the average wage per ride and per driver. Most rides would seem to be over shorter distances and therefor 
generate less money per ride

### Suburban Cities
Suburban cities are the middle of the three city types in every category. This directly reflects a setting that is less dense but still accessible

### Rural Cities
Rural cities statistics reflect their urban counterparts in reversely porportionate ways. They generate the least overall and have the least amount of riders
and drivers. But they generate the most money per ride and per driver (Nearly four times the amount per driver).

All 3 city types do not show any direct trend of fare amount related to month as shown in the following image they stay relatively stable each month

## Summary
There are a few suggestions we can make for PyBer

The trend of the data shows that drivers in rural areas tend to make nearly four times that of their urban counterparts compared to the overall
fares of their city. This suggests that there may be too little drivers servicing the PyBer ride sharing customers. A promotional or hiring
event may prove very useful in making the service more accessible.

On the reverse side of this, there is a very large number of drivers in urban settings. In fact there is more drivers than there is total rides.
It may be in PyBers best interest to attempt to advertise their product to more potential urban customers to increase rides.

A final recommendation is to diversify the variety of ways customers can use the PyBer ride sharing service. Customers in rural settings need more access
and there is too large of a driver saturation in urban settings. Investing in cross city travel such as trains or busses to connect and address both problems
may prove to increase amount customers and adress the driver saturation in different city settings.
